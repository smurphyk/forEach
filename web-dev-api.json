  "definition": "A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax. While several markup languages exist, the two most popular are HTML and XML",
  "translation": "Markup languages create a bridge between humans and computers. By using tags and attributes, markup languages allow humans to use a language they understand to tell computers/browsers what to display. Basically, Markup languages allow people to communicate to a computer/browser in a much easier way, through common keywords that people can associate with common functionality."
